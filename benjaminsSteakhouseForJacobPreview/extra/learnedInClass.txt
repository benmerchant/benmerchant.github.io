I went to BV's site to appropriate their favicon
I noticed that the rel attribute had two values
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://www.bridgevalley.edu/sites/default/files/favIcon.png" type="image/png">
Excuse me, what the heck?
Never heard of shortcut. Found and article from 2010 called rel="shortcut icon" considered harmful

BTW, BV was founded in 2014
Another supporting thread from StackOverflow

The question was asked and answered in 2012
