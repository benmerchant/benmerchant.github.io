Components
- Navbar
- Button
- Card (default border{1px solid rgba0,0,0,0,125} radius 0.25rem)
- Carousel

Utilities
- py-3
- py-5 (every section in index)
- mb-3
- text-center (every section in index)
- bg-white
- w-100
- text-white
- font-weight-bold
- text-uppercase (index section headings)
- d-flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-content-around (menu headings)
- p-0 m-0 (menu headings)
- justify-content-center (after setting max width for menu item cards,
                          they were aligned left, quite unsightly)
- mx-auto (only works with fixed width items)


Typography
- blockquote
- come back and use this responsiveness

Utilities replaced a lot of the convoluted classes from BS v3.
"page-header" for one, ..... finish this thought...


Had to resize all of the images for the events carousel
So the div wouldn't change sizes.
The width is always the same, but the height changes,
like when using ".card"
Which just reminded me....
I need to go back and do it for the cards,
as right now, I am only using one image for all items

-------------------Dec 5th-------------------
- This is turning into just notes for my presentation...

- Uploaded to my github pages site to show my boss, Jacob what I've been working on
- Added font awesome to get some icons going
-- both a steak "knife" and a "cow" are PRO icons only lol
-- as this isn't the root folder in my repo nor my BVCSCT dir the "home" href will have to be absolute
-- https://www.seoclarity.net/resources/knowledgebase/difference-relative-absolute-url-15325/
-- guess its good for SEO as well ^^^^
--- TO DO --- : fix it so its nice for Jason when for actual submission
