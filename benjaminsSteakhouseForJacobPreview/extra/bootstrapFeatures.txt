Components
- Navbar
- Button
- Card (default border{1px solid rgba0,0,0,0,125} radius 0.25rem)
- Carousel

Utilities
- py-3
- py-5 (every section in index)
- mb-3
- text-center (every section in index)
- bg-white
- w-100
- text-white
- font-weight-bold
- text-uppercase (index section headings)
- d-flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-content-around (menu headings)
- p-0 m-0 (menu headings)
- justify-content-center (after setting max width for menu item cards,
                          they were aligned left, quite unsightly)
- mx-auto (only works with fixed width items)


Typography
- blockquote
- come back and use this responsiveness

Utilities replaced a lot of the convoluted classes from BS v3.
"page-header" for one, ..... finish this thought...


Had to resize all of the images for the events carousel
So the div wouldn't change sizes.
The width is always the same, but the height changes,
like when using ".card"
Which just reminded me....
I need to go back and do it for the cards,
as right now, I am only using one image for all items

- This is turning into just notes for my presentation...

- Uploaded to my github pages site to show my boss, Jacob what I've been working on
- Added font awesome to get some icons going
-- both a steak "knife" and a "cow" are PRO icons only lol
-- as this isn't the root folder in my repo nor my BVCSCT dir the "home" href will have to be absolute
-- https://www.seoclarity.net/resources/knowledgebase/difference-relative-absolute-url-15325/
-- guess its good for SEO as well ^^^^
--- TO DO --- : fix it so its nice for Jason when for actual submission
-- new FontAwesome has SVG icons! along with some JS and new simple/interesting ways (that are just like Bootstrap.{ b/c that's why it was invented. source[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_Awesome]}) to manipulate the icons

- should probably track what BS templates I effectively copypasta'd
######################## BS TEMPLATES ########################
1. Sticky footer. Not that it would matter for the index which will always be larger than any ViewPort

- same thing for some restaurant sites i used for inspiration
- will clarify with Jason tomorrow to ensure it is not plagiarism
- I believe it is not because I merely took some of their ideas
-- and adapted them to my needs. Some elements are similar,
-- but much like the templates, there is only one way to do things
-- even in those cases, I used BS utility classes as much as possible
-- as opposed to writing new classes
---- Once I complete the project, I will design a page comparing and contrasting
---- what I did. Would make a good blog post

INSPO notes:
+ tomato site used BS 3.3.1 I'm using 4.1.3. One interesting thing is the page
    header class that was deprecated in BS v4. I learned about this while working
    on my capstone in Spring 2018, when I was going through an AngularJS ebook from Packt.
    This was when I learned how to use the BS utilities that replaced a lot of
    classes from prior versions.
