        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>
          Start POS is my capstone project from college. It is the realization
          of a long-time desire to design the perfect Point of Sale (POS) system for
          a restaurant. This is meant to be an all-in-one content management system
          as well as a POS. Including the menu and employee management.
          <br><br>
          This is a POSaaS, Point of Sale as a Service. POSs are typically sold
          as a one time purchase and you often have to call for service if something
          goes wrong. A restaurant owner will usually have to purchase a computer
          from the POS provider. I plan for this to be usable on any device.

        <h3>What is it made of?</h3>
        <p>
          The backend is a Node.js API implementing Express.js. The data is stored
          on a MongoDB server. The front-end utilizes AngularJS. The front and back
          ends are hosted independently on AWS. The API is tested with Mocha.
          <br><br>
          I am developing in the browswer first. It's simple to test the API
          this way. Once the endpoints are fully tested the next step will be to
          develop the iOS and Android apps.

        <h3>Why isn't there much to it?</h3>
        <p>
          What you see so far was created in four months time (one semester).
          Most of that time was spent learning the frameworks, which was the goal
          of the project, to learn. It did earn me an A for the course.
          <br><br>
          Initially the front and back ends were together in Express.js using
          Handlebars for the front end. Once I started to get into AngularJS I
          realized I needed to bifurcate the two into separate entities. This required
          starting over from line 1.

        <h3>What makes it different?</h3>
        <p>
          Start POS completely encompassses all the needs of a restaurant, including
          employee scheduling, time-clock tracking, and management-employee communication.
          <br><br>
          I know what works in restaurants. More importantly, I know the pain points.
          Every server complains about the POS of their store. There are some great
          ones out there. There are also some really bad ones. But they all have
          something that they are good at. 
        </p>

      <div class="flexMaxWidth">
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
          Over the next few months the app will be fully-fleshed out. The goal
          is to get it into a restaurant within a year. In that time I will have
          to learn Android and iOS development.
